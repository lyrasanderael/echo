**Purpose:**  
Describe Echo’s high-level architecture, components, and data flows.  
Echo operates fully on local systems by default. It can also run on external servers or cloud providers, but hardware isolation, encryption at rest, VM snapshots, and physical access controls are outside Echo’s trust boundary.

**Audience:**  
Architects, developers, technical leads.

**Contents:**  
- Global architecture  
- Component boundaries  
- Data pipelines  
- Trust/security zones  
- Sequence diagrams  

**When to update:**  
When architecture changes or new global components are added.
