**Purpose:**  
Document the core Echo framework responsible for orchestration, pipelines, and module management.  
Echo is designed as a local-first framework but can run on remote or cloud infrastructure with reduced privacy guarantees, as underlying hardware and storage controls remain outside the trust boundary.

**Audience:**  
Framework developers and maintainers.

**Contents:**  
- Core responsibilities  
- Pipeline engine  
- Module registry  
- Data contracts  
- Configuration system  

**When to update:**  
When core APIs or orchestration logic evolve.
