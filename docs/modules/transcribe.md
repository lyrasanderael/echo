**Purpose:**  
Define the ASR module architecture (Echo Transcribe) and supported engines.  
Local-first ASR execution is recommended for privacy; cloud/server deployments reduce guarantees due to hardware and storage controls outside Echo’s boundary.

**Audience:**  
ASR developers and pipeline maintainers.

**Contents:**  
- Engines (Whisper, Vosk, Voxtral)  
- Input/output schema  
- Performance notes  
- WER/CER methodology  

**When to update:**  
When new ASR engines or schema changes occur.
